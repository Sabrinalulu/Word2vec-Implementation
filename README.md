# Word2vec-Implementation
Present word2vec on the website using xampp

Fllow the Online handbook of Wiki Word2vec implementation (http://textminingonline.com/training-word2vec-model-on-english-wikipedia-by-gensim) to build your dataset's vector and model.

1. Set files in the backend and all model files, including trained model, trained vector, model.syn1neg.npy, model.wv.syn0.npy under the path: xampp/htdocs. 
2. Turn on the Apache service provided by XAMPP. 
3. Run the word2vec.html.

The php file fetched the word and sent it back:
